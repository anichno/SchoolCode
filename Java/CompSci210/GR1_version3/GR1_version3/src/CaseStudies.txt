a) What major principle of code implementation does the code on the right 
   violate - as compared to the code on the left?

The code on the right does not properly scope the "j" variable, while the left 
creates the variable in the context of which it will be used.

b) Why is this principle important?
 
This is important because it creates cleaner and easier to read code while also
protecting variables from being used in different locations and possibly starting in 
unknown states.
